## Assignment
Create a sticky note application where:
* a user can load a page showing all the notes in the db right now
* a user can add a new note

Extra super bonus!
* the user can drag stickynotes to a new order and have that order saved.

## Next steps
* make a model (think about your db table - what is it called? What fields does it have?)
    * create a dbset for it in data.cs
* do scaffolding.
    * Scaffolding:
        * the point is: instead of copy-pasting a thousand times, go in and edit code that's already there
        * Adds the CRUD actions/views to go with your DB
        * Your computer basically sets things up for you.
            * Your computer - an mvc command that you run
    * GRIME: Get Ready, I'm Making Everything
    * model is used to figure out how to set up everything - must exist first.
* make the table in the db - 'migrate'
* run it! make sure you can create stickies!
* start making it look/work like you actually want it to.
